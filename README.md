# Full-Stack-Project
This project is in the initial stage. FlaskServer.py is a RESTFUL API that provides Geographical latitude and longitude of a particular place of end user's choice.getLAtLong.py is the function that in turns makes a call to the google Geocode API to retrieve the latitude and longitude. More functionalities will be added later.
Any new ideas will always be entertained
